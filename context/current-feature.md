### Foundation & Scaffold
Stood up the full stack: stripped starter-kit auth to a seeded demo admin, Postgres 16 Docker Compose, `pg_trgm` migration, Givebutter brand theming, and a `/health` gate.

### Data Layer — Migrations & Models
Eleven migrations and nine models mirroring Givebutter's verified API schema, with `archived_at` soft-delete, blocking-key columns, and mass-assignment guards on the derived giving fields. Added `tags` after checking the ERD against the real OpenAPI spec.

### Seed Data — Curated Demo Set
`DemoSeeder` builds 2,018 deterministic contacts: two hero cases at stable IDs, seven review-band pairs, and noise that can't reach the Review band. Pulled the `Normalizer` forward and moved the suite onto Postgres, since `pg_trgm` can't be tested on SQLite.
